# Cycling Mobile App

Me and my friend Emre developed this project for our final project in Mobile Systems lesson in Schmalkalden which we enrolled for Erasmus+ exchange.

We aimed this app to help cyclists to keep track of their speed and path length during their trip. 

We used acceleration and GPS sensors and also used camera for saving the memories with a photo.

We hope you like our project.

Thanks
